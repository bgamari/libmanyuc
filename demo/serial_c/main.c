 This example demonstrates the different ways of sending strings
 through the serial port: blocking, non-blocking, background,
 using fprintf.

 Finally, the main loop repeats all the characters received from the
 serial port, through the serial port.  It also shows the lower half
 of the byte received using the leds.
