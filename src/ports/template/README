Hi,

This is the template directory for creating a new port for libmanyuc.

There are many stubs that need to be filled in order for the library to
work properly.  However, you don't need to fill them all at once, you can
start implementing it bit by bit, leaving the rest of the features as
stubs.

To add your own architecture, copy this directory with a new name
representing the architecture that you want to port and start modifying the
files as appropriate.

Happy Hacking!
