Hi!

This is the libmanyuc (library for many microcontrollers) code. You'll
find the source code of the library in the src/ directory, the
documentation can be generated using Doxygen, from the doc/ directory
and there are plenty of examples in the demo/ directory.

In order to compile the library you'll have to choose the target
architecture (currently only mbed supported, more to come soon), and set
the PATH where the binaries for the compiler are located. This can be done
in the config.mk file, or in the Makefile of the demo file.

In order to build your own project, copy one of the demo directories and
start from there.

You can program either in C or C++, the functions available are the same,
when using C++ you get a more object oriented experience.  The target
architecture, the language of choice and other information are set inside
the Makefile of your project.

Have fun using libmanyuc!
